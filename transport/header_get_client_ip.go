// GetClientIP returns the client IP address for the request, using the X-Forwarded-For chain only to the extent it can be trusted.
//
// trustedProxyHops is the number of reverse-proxy hops in front of this service. Each trusted proxy is expected to APPEND the IP of the connection it received from to X-Forwarded-For (this is what AWS ALB does). The rightmost trustedProxyHops entries in the chain are therefore the ones written by trusted infrastructure, and the entry at position `len(parts) - trustedProxyHops` is the IP of the original client as observed by the outermost trusted proxy.
//
// When trustedProxyHops is 0 (no trusted proxy in front), the X-Forwarded-For header is ignored entirely — it is fully attacker-controlled and must not be used for any security-sensitive purpose such as rate limiting. RemoteAddr is returned instead.
//
// When fewer XFF entries are present than expected, the trusted-proxy chain was not fully traversed, and we fall back to RemoteAddr rather than risk trusting an attacker-supplied entry.
