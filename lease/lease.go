// Package lease provides a distributed single-holder lease primitive backed by a SQL table. It lets multiple service pods coordinate so that a periodic task runs on exactly one pod at a time, while the other pods skip the tick.
//
// The typical flow is:
//
//	l := lease.New(repo)
//	err := l.WithLease(ctx, "agent-scheduler", 90*time.Second, func(ctx context.Context) error {
//	    return scheduler.checkSchedules(ctx)
//	})
//
// WithLease acquires the lease, runs fn with a context that is cancelled if the lease is lost, renews the lease at ttl/3 while fn runs, and releases it on exit. If another pod currently holds the lease, WithLease returns nil without running fn.
